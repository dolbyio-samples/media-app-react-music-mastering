Create your App key and App secret:

1. Log in to the Dolby.io developer dashboard: https://dashboard.dolby.io/.
2. Click **ADD NEW APP**.
3. In the **Application Name** box, enter your application name.
4. In the **API Keys** column, in the same row as your application, click **Get API keys**.
5. Click **Copy** to copy your App key and App secret.

# How to run the Music Mastering app

Below is a list of steps that show you how to run the app locally. In addition to the Music Mastering app, this repository contains a local application server that works with the Music Mastering app to make secure calls to the Music Mastering API. 

Before you get started with running the Music Mastering app, please make sure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) version 2 or later installed. NPM is not supported at this time. 

**NOTE**: This application server is for demo purposes only. 

## Clone the repository

Use Git to clone this repository `https://github.com/dolbyio-samples/media-app-react-music-mastering.git` or download and unzip the repository using the green button on the top of this page.

## Add your App key and App secret to the environment variables file

1. Copy the `apps/mm-server/.env.local.example` file and rename it: `apps/mm-server/.env.local`.
2. In the `apps/mm-server/.env.local` file, update the "replace" values to work with your environment.

## Create and install the Music Mastering application server certificate

To use the application server, you must install a certificate to set up the Secure Sockets Layer. 
Before you start, install the [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) Command Line Interface.

1. Install the local CA in the system trust store using the following command:

```shell
mkcert -install
```

2. Run the following commands to generate a certificate for the local machine:

```shell
mkcert \
    -cert-file ./apps/mm-server/src/certs/localhost.pem \
    -key-file ./apps/mm-server/src/certs/localhost-key.pem \
    localhost
```

## Install dependencies

Using the terminal, in the root directory, install dependencies with this [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) command:

```shell
yarn
```

## Build the Music Mastering application package dependencies

The following command builds the application dependencies and also builds a distribution package. You can find the package in the `/dist` directory.

```shell
yarn build:all
```

## Start the Music Mastering application server and app

You must start the application server and the Music Mastering app in separate terminal windows.

Before you start the Music Mastering sample app, make sure no applications are using port 4200.

1. Open a terminal window and run the following command to start the backend:

```shell
yarn start:mm-server
```

2. Open a new terminal window and run the following command to start the frontend:

```shell
yarn start:mm-sample
```

When the commands are complete, the sample app URL http://localhost:4200 is displayed. Copy and paste the URL into your browser to view the Music Mastering app.
